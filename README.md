# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-LinearRegression
The Wine Quality Prediction project aims to determine the quality of wines based on specific attributes using linear regression.By training a machine learning model on a dataset comprising various wine characteristics,the model can predict the quality rating of a given wine sample.The Jupyter notebook code offers insights into the data preprocessing,model training,and evaluation stages.We will explore the data.its distributions and correlations,deal with outliers,select features,from hypothesis and test them,try different linear regression algorithms,and finally tune the model with the best performance.
